<p>Massive Attack is an English music group founded in 1988 by Robert "3D" del Naja, Grantley "Daddy G" Marshall, and  Andy "Mushroom" Vowles. Combining down-tempo beats with soothing vocals, the trio produced a music falling into the category of trip-hop. Their debut album <em> Blue Lines </em> was released in 1991 and contained the single <em> Unfinished Symphony </em>. The song was hailed as the 63rd greatest song of all time by British music magazine New Musical Express (NME). I'd say the our lives as human are divided into chapters that make up one whole story.</p>

<p>At the moment, Massive Attack is a big part of this current chapter in my life. I've delved into the world of 90s and 2000's culture, appreciating the style, values, and ideas; not to mention the ambitious imagination of their respective genereations when it cames to the future. It's interesting. Massive Attack has some gorgeous vocal tracks throughout their albums, but there is a special one that stood out to me. In fact, I think it just might be the most beautiful song I've ever heard (or at least for this chapter of my life). But I won't divulge its title. You'll just have to immerse yourself in 3D, Mush, and Tricky's world to find it...</p>
